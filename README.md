# DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT 1

## The Number Guessing Game

A simple project where the player has to guess a random number chosen between 1 & 100. Error handling is in place if the player guesses outside of the bounds, enters a non-number guess and let's them know if their guess was too low or too high. Upon winning, statistics show, a high score is kept and they have the option to play again.

To run, simply run `python3 app.py` in your terminal.
